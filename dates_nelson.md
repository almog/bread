Make the soaker one day ahead:
In a bowl, cover the seeds with the boiling water, wrap in nylon and let sit in room temperature for 6-24 hours.

Mix everything but the dates, the shortening and the Tahini.
Let it autolyse for 20 minutes.

In the meanwhile, if the dates are hard, let them sit for few minutes in barely simmering water.
Drain and let it come down to 40C or less.

Mix in the dates and shortening, fold inside the bowl, let it sit for 20 minutes and repeat 4 times.
Let it bulk rise until it doubles (about 10 hours), degas let it double again, shape and bake.
